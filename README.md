## üìò Overview

This project describes the implementation of a Data Leak Prevention (DLP) framework using **FortiGate Firewall**, **Active Directory**, and **Google Workspace**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Objective: Prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive data from within the network.

...

## üî• Firewall-Level Controls (FortiGate)

### ‚úÖ Implementation Steps:
1. **Create a Test Policy**

> A test policy is created in the firewall and placed in the top of list to

2. **Set Application Filter**
3. **Configure Web Filter**
4. **Restrict Gmail Logins (non-whitelisted domains)**
5. **Apply to test systems and monitor**

### ‚ùó Challenges Faced:
- Managing **exceptions** for trusted domains/sites
- Need for **SSL inspection certificate** installation across endpoints

---

## üß© Active Directory Configuration (via GPO)

- Restrict user privileges
- Disable Bluetooth file sharing
- Block browser extension installations
- Disable mobile hotspot sharing

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Workspace DLP Settings

- Enable protection against phishing attacks
- Allow email communication only with approved domains
- Restrict Drive file sharing to trusted domains

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project leverages existing tools to establish an effective, policy-driven DLP framework while maintaining ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 13485 compliance.
